## FAQ

#### Can Station Tracks be powered?

Yes! In fact, they are designed to be used both powered and unpowered.  Powered Station Tracks are meant to be at the ends of your hauling lines because they automatically turn carts around after they've been stationed.  Unpowered Station Tracks send minecarts in the direction they were originally going after being stationed.

#### Can I configure a Station Track to be ignored?

Yep. Set the Station Track to wait for 0 seconds. The Station Track will then act as a normal rail.

#### Have any more questions?  Reach out to me on Steam @kn0wmad1c or on the Necesse discord.
